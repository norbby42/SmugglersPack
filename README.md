# Smuggler's Pack

A mod for Obenseuer that adds a "Smuggler's Pack Insert", a new item that can only be placed in the last slot of backpacks and prevents the police from detecting items in the bottom row of the backpack.
Think of it like a false bottom for the backpack.

## Crafting

The recipe for the insert can be learned from the OS Magazine, but is not required to perform the craft.
The craft costs: 1 Empty Backpack, 1 Cloth Roll, 4 Thread, 2 Scrap Metal
It has a high fail chance: you may want to skill up your Sewing and look into some shroomy enhancements.

## Installation

Just like all other Obenseuer mods, you must first have BepInEx installed (https://stalburg.net/Obenseuer/Modding).
Once that is done, extract the .zip to the Obenseuer/BepInEx/plugins folder.

## Configuration

After running the game once, a config file will be created at BepInEx/Config/SmugglersPack.cfg
Open in any text editor while the game is closed and you can adjust some settings (primarily UI).
If you want to tweak the recipe, that is stored in the recipes.json file in the Obenseuer/BepInEx/plugins/SmugglersPack folder.  Do not edit the game's standard recipes.json.

## Notes

Crummy art by yours truly (Quackers).  There's no model when it is dropped in the world, just a cube.  Anyone who wants to contribute better art, please send me a pull request ().
The art for this mod is contained in the plugin folder.
